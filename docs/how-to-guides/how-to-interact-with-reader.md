# Work with Reader
Reader has to be given some specific input files which are required for its operation. They may come from the instrument provided file and files that user provided meatadata or ELN schema file to write your metadata via NOMAD.

The reader basically needs three types of input files -

1. Raw Data Files: Files that generated by the software of the instrument. These files may contain some metadata but not all the metadata that is required by the NeXus application definition.

2. ELN Schema File: A yaml schema file that contains schema structure following the NeXus application defintiion and metadata for NOMAD (for NOMAD internal use). NOMAD reads such schema file and render a GUI where user can fill the metadata corresponding the NeXus schema. Later, nomad generates structural a yaml file which will directly read by the raader.

Typical contents of the ELN schema file and it's Graphical Representation in NOMAD
